# Networking Port Scanner

A lightweight but insightful port scanner built using Python.  
It detects open TCP ports, identifies associated services, and maps basic security risks.  
This project is ideal for learning socket programming, reconnaissance, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## 🔍 Features

- Scans commonly used TCP ports
- Identifies associated services (FTP, SSH, HTTP, MySQL…)
- Provides security risk insight for known services
- Clean, readable terminal output
- Uses Python’s socket library (no external dependencies)
